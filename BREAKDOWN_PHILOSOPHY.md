# Task Breakdown Philosophy

## Core Principle: Work AROUND Blockers, Not Through Them

The AI task breakdown system now follows a philosophy of enabling immediate action despite uncertainty or blockers. Instead of trying to solve every decision upfront, we create paths that allow progress while deferring difficult choices.

## Key Strategies

### 1. Partial Progress Over Perfect Planning
- Start with what CAN be done now
- Focus on clearing the clearable
- Defer decisions without guilt

### 2. No Questions as Steps
Instead of:
- ❌ "Decide where items will go"
- ❌ "Figure out tracking format"
- ❌ "Determine the best approach"

We create:
- ✓ "Put away items that already have homes"
- ✓ "Start tracking in simplest format (bullet list)"
- ✓ "Try the most obvious approach for 10 minutes"

### 3. Scaffold Decisions Through Action
- Make decisions experiments, not commitments
- Use temporary solutions as stepping stones
- Allow refinement through iteration

### 4. Handle Blockers Strategically
When user mentions a blocker like "don't know where things go":
1. First step: Deal with items that DO have clear homes
2. Second step: Contain unclear items for later
3. Third step: Try temporary solutions for a few items
4. Final step: Label and defer the rest officially

## Examples

### Cleaning Task with Location Uncertainty
Old approach:
1. Decide where everything goes
2. Organize by category
3. Put everything away

New approach:
1. Put away items with existing homes
2. Gather homeless items in one container
3. Clear obvious trash only
4. Try temporary spots for 2-3 items
5. Label container "Sort by [date]"

### Writing Task with Format Uncertainty
Old approach:
1. Choose the perfect format
2. Plan the structure
3. Write the content

New approach:
1. Write main points as bullet list
2. Expand easiest point into sentences
3. Try basic format for 10 minutes
4. Note remaining decisions for later

## Implementation Notes

The system now:
- Prioritizes immediate actionability
- Works around mentioned blockers
- Enables progress without perfect clarity
- Reduces decision paralysis
- Allows iterative refinement

This approach acknowledges that for ADHD minds, action often clarifies better than planning, and partial progress builds momentum better than perfect preparation.
