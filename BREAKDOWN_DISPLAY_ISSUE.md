# AI Task Breakdown Display Issue

## Problem Description
The AI Task Breakdown component is creating steps successfully but they aren't being displayed in the UI.

## Analysis Summary

### What's Working ✅
1. API calls are successful
2. Groq format conversion is working correctly
3. breakdownOptions state is being populated
4. The render logic conditions are correct

### What's Not Working ❌
1. The breakdown options aren't appearing in the UI after generation
2. The component state shows options exist but they don't render

## Debugging Steps Taken

1. **Added console logs** throughout the component to track:
   - State changes
   - API responses
   - Render conditions
   - Component lifecycle

2. **Created test files**:
   - `test-groq-conversion.js` - Verified Groq format conversion works
   - `debug-breakdown-issue.js` - Verified state logic is correct
   - `test-actual-breakdown.html` - Simulated the full workflow
   - `AITaskBreakdownDebug.tsx` - Debug version of the component

3. **Key Findings**:
   - The logic `breakdownOptions.length > 0 && !showContextForm` is correct
   - State transitions happen as expected
   - The conversion from Groq format works properly

## Potential Issues to Check

1. **React State Updates**: The state might not be triggering a re-render
2. **Parent Component**: The parent might be affecting the modal display
3. **CSS Issues**: Styles might be hiding the content
4. **Card Component**: The Card component might have rendering issues

## Next Steps

1. **Use the Debug Component**: Import `AITaskBreakdownDebug` instead of `AITaskBreakdown` to see real-time state
2. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any JavaScript errors during rendering
3. **Inspect Elements**: Use browser dev tools to see if elements are in DOM but hidden
4. **Test with Simple HTML**: Replace Card components with simple divs temporarily

## Temporary Workaround
If needed, you can temporarily replace the Card mapping with simple HTML:

```jsx
{breakdownOptions.map(option => (
  <div key={option.id} style={{ border: '1px solid #ccc', padding: '10px', margin: '5px 0' }}>
    <h4>{option.title}</h4>
    <p>{option.description}</p>
  </div>
))}
```

This will help determine if the issue is with the Card component or the state management.
