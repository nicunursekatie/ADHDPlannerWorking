# AI Task Breakdown Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Infinite Re-rendering Bug
**Problem**: Component was re-rendering infinitely due to console.log in component body
**Solution**: Removed the problematic console.log that was directly in the component body:
```typescript
// REMOVED: console.log('Initial showContextForm state:', alwaysAskContext !== 'false', 'alwaysAskContext:', alwaysAskContext);
```

### 2. Groq JSON Format Issue
**Problem**: Groq was returning a different JSON structure (`{Step: "..."}`) than expected
**Solution**: Added format detection and conversion logic:
```typescript
// Handle Groq's different response format
if (steps.length > 0 && steps[0].Step) {
  console.log('Detected Groq format, converting...');
  steps = steps.map((step, index) => ({
    title: step.Step || `Step ${index + 1}`,
    duration: '5-10 mins',
    description: step.Step || `Step ${index + 1}`,
    type: 'work',
    energyRequired: 'medium',
    tips: 'Focus on this specific action'
  }));
}
```

## Results
1. Component no longer re-renders infinitely
2. Groq responses are properly converted to the expected format
3. Subtasks display correctly instead of showing undefined values
4. Context form submission works properly

## Testing
Created test files to verify the fixes:
- `test-ai-breakdown.html` - Interactive test page
- `test-groq-conversion.js` - Direct conversion logic test

The conversion test confirms that:
- Groq's `{Step: "..."}` format is correctly detected
- Steps are properly converted to the expected structure
- Edge cases (undefined, empty arrays) are handled correctly
